When we refactor, we're never entirely sure that the new form is better than the old. We "see" "enough" of it in our minds to understand the shape of the new form, but as to it's adequacy, we always guess. We relate past experiences and make aesthetic judgments and wonder how much effort it would be to convince others. We do not decide rationally.

These are two anecdotes where I clearly didn't understand the tool I was using, but I didn't understand them because I came to the docs with operational metaphors for the tools already formed.

There are circumstances where the move from monolith to services is warranted. I don't know what they are -- we don't have enough data -- but that shouldn't stop you from attempting the transition. Kuhn shows us scientists don't adopt new paradigms (and services **is** a different paradigm) rationally, based on careful examination of available data -- no new paradigm solves all the problems it's predecesor did, but it has *something* that instills confidence it will -- but emotionally, based on social and aesthetic factors.
