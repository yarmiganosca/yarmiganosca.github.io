<p>Now, the thing I have the most opinions about: Copeland&#8217;s proposal for the structuring of Business Logic. I will say right away I think <code>ActiveService</code> would be a good addition to Rails. MVC as a pattern (server-side MVC; client-side MVC is older and different) was never intended to structure Business Logic. The authors of the 2002 pattern <a href="https://pyha.ru/forum/attachment/4429/">concluded by saying</a></p>

<p>We have not devoted a great deal of discussion to the business logic layer, because we consider it to be a normal OO program.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always been a failing of Rails that the framework hasn&#8217;t provided a good place to put Business Logic. It&#8217;s always been a worse failing that it hasn&#8217;t recognized this. Models aren&#8217;t the right place. And this isn&#8217;t about fidelity to the original pattern. I don&#8217;t care whether Rails uses MVC or doesn&#8217;t; but the pattern has a specific technical situation it&#8217;s designed to be applied in. It has a specific set of strengths and weaknesses; it has a specific set of things it does help with and things it doesn&#8217;t help with. It doesn&#8217;t help with Business Logic. Rails believing it does has always been the framework&#8217;s deepest flaw.</p>

<p>Back to the present, I wouldn&#8217;t use <code>ActiveService::Base</code> use to structure my Business Logic. Object domain models are best left organic and lumpy, clumping and grouping as they and the designer see fit. Having a overarching design plan in mind before you start modelling (and these services are a prefab design plan) just means you&#8217;ll have to rip it out once you find something that <em>does</em> fit. The fact that we&#8217;re not mixing persistence logic in doesn&#8217;t change that. But, if <code>ActiveService</code> were to be included in Rails, I would be ecstatic, if only because it would allow us to have a concrete <em>thing</em> around which to have badly needed OO design discussions as teams and as a community.</p>
